# **Authentication Demonstration**

## **Login UI & Route Access Control**  
Before logging in, users cannot access any other routes. The authentication system ensures restricted access until valid credentials are provided. Additionally, the UI supports **dark mode and light mode**, allowing users to switch themes seamlessly.

## **Handling Invalid Credentials**  
If a user enters incorrect credentials, an error message is displayed, preventing access. This ensures security by not allowing unauthorized logins.

## **Form Validation**

## **Accessing Routes After Successful Login & Logout Functionality**  
Upon successful login, all restricted routes become accessible. The user can navigate through the dashboard and log out when needed. Logging out revokes access, ensuring session security.
